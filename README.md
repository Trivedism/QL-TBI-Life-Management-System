# QL-TBI-Life-Management-System
"Veterans with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) find it difficult to manage their daily life activities and appointments.  A mobile application and/or tool is needed to help focus and assist them with short term memory challenges and progressive cognitive decline. The capability would provide support to easily manage their daily life schedule with features such as viewing tailored calendars, setting reminders, making to do lists, providing event alarms, etc. The objective is to provide structure, ease of routine, and increased independence."
